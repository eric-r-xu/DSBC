Client and question/need: A horror filmmaker wants to create a wide-release horror film in the U.S. and wants to increase the movieÕs profitability ((domestic total gross Ð budget)/months since release) by focusing on relevant features (listed below).
My "population" of movies: all wide release horror movies from 2000 to 2013 (theaters released>n)
Features per movie: Distributor, Director, Rating (PG, R etc.), Budget, Month or Season, lead character gender
